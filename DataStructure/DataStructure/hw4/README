Comp15 HW4
*******************************************************************************
Purpose of the program

The purpose of the program is implement a alphabetizer, we can input words, and
the program will output the words in alphabet order.
*******************************************************************************
How to run

To run this program, just make sure the Makefile is in the same folder with the 
other files. And type make in terminal. Than you can type in ./main or ./main \
filename order to use this program.

Acknowledgements

I write this program all by my self. I should say thanks to piazza and Mark, 
they helped me a lot.

*******************************************************************************
Alphabetizer.cpp
Alphabetizer.h  :       In these file, I define and inplemented Alphabetizer
                        class.

AlphaTesting.cpp:       This is the file I used to test my Alphabetizer class.

StringBST.cpp 
StringBST.h :           In these files, I defined and implemented StringBST
                        class.

BSTTesting.cpp:         This is the file I used to test my StringBST class.

file:                   This is the file I used to test my second run function.

main.cpp:               This is the main function of the program.

*******************************************************************************
DataStructure

In this program, I choose to use nodes and pointer to implement my BST. I used 
BST sorting, insertion, delete, clear and other functions. I am also taking 
comp160, so I think this homework could be a really good practicing for my 
algorithm.

*******************************************************************************
Because there is two exames and 4 homework due this week, I didn't have enough
time to thinking and write and test my comp15 homework, which I was very sorry
about. I have to use 2 token to try my best to do this work, but time was still
too tight for me. Maybe I still need more procticing.

In this program, I write StringBST class first, and I use a BSTTesting.cpp to 
test it. And than I write the Alphabetizer class whitch is much easier than the
former one I thought. There is still a problem with the "eof" thing, but time 
is up. I'll stll work on it until I make it. Wish you could still grade my work
then.
