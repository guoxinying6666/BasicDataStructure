Assignment name: Project1

Data structure: Queue, Linkedlist, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree.

Objective: The project put object survoivors into binaritree first.Then comparing 2 BinaryTrees and find which one have less leaves. 
Then comparing their ages of the most right leave and the most left leave until find the one whose age is the cloest to the average age.

Overall structure: Firstly, I create a class survivor to record survivor's information. Secondly, I create BinaryTree class to establish a BinaryTree. BinaryTree used a Queue as its structure. And BinarySearchTree inheritaged BinaryTree. And driver use the tow trees to generate data structure to store survivor's data and find the winer.
